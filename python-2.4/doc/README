Configuration:

The following settings can be set in the global configuration file.
Its path on unixish systems is /etc/httpovclient.conf

Options set in the global configuration file can be overridden
in the running user's configuration file.
Its path is either ~/.httpovclient/prefs or  ~/_httpovclient/prefs

HP_SERVER=""

The URL of the HTTPov server to use.

HP_PASSWORD="flimpaflump"

Not used.

HP_POV="povray"

The name of the POV-Ray executable. POVRay for Windows is called pvengine.exe

HP_POVDIR=""

The path to the POV-Ray executable. A default installation of
POV-Ray for Windows doesn't add the executable to the path.

HP_VERURL="http://columbiegg.com/httpov/latest/"

Where to look for messages about client updates.

HP_VERPER=259200

How often, in seconds, to look for client updates. The default
is once every 72 hours.

HP_TRYTIMES=10

How many times to retry network connections before giving up.
0 means try forever.

HP_GROUP=""

Clients can be grouped in client groups, for statistical purposes.
This way, rendering statistics can be done for groups of separate
computers, as well as for concurrent clients using one computer's
separate cores.

sleepmax=300

The client has an exponential back-off when retrying. sleepmax is the
upper limit in seconds.

nicelevel=5

As the client will execute time consuming POV-Ray jobs, the process will
be niced to nicelevel on systems supporting os.nice(). Changed to 5, 
because the former 10 caused some systems not to scale up the CPU 
frequency.

The client ID for each client can be set using the command line:

httpovclient.py 999

will set HP_CID to 999, instead of the process' PID.

The following setting can be set in the global configuration file,
but will not do anything useful in the user configuration file:

HP_USER=""

The user name of the user to run the client as if it is started
by root. For security reasons, running as root is not supported.

The setting will largely be disregarded if the script is not run 
by root.
